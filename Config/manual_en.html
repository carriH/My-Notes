            <h2>Before starting</h2>
            <p>For the correct operation of the extension, it is necessary to have it loaded and working before loading the page on which the notes are going to be added. For this reason, it is necessary to reload all the opened pages after installing the
                application if you want to add annotations.
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My notes is a Firefox extension that allows you to quickly add annotations inside a web page. Once they are added, they will be shown in te same position next time the page is loaded. This extension has different annotation types, that can be classified
                in 3 main groups:
                <ul>
                    <li>Text notes</li>
                    <li>Multimedia notes</li>
                    <li>Highlight text notes</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Text notes</h3>
            <p>
                Creates a textbox note in the selected point of the page. That note can be moved around the page by dragging it with the mouse, or resized by dragging the edges or the corners of the note (there is a minimum width and height size in the note). In order
                to write text, just click inside the box and start writing. Changes in each note are automatically saved when the note loses the focus (user clicks outside of the note), or when releasing the mouse (in case user is moving or resizing the
                note).

            <h3>Multimedia notes</h3>
            <p>
                Creates an audio or video note in the selected point of the page. When it is created, it is shown as an icon that identifies the type of note that has been added (a microphone in case of audio notes and a video camera in case of video notes). Pressing
                the icon will start the recording and the color of the icon will change to red. Pressing it again will stop the recording and the icon will change again to denote that the content has been recorded (it will show a musical note in case
                of an audio notes and a movie frame in case of video notes).
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking again into the icon will show a multimedia player with which you can play the recording. The arrow icon displayed over the player can be used to toggle between the icon and the player. It is possible to move the icon (or the player) around the
                page by dragging it with the mouse, as well as resizing the player by dragging the edges (audio notes can only be resized horizontally, while video notes can be resized in any direction, adjusting always the video to the size of the note
                while retaining the ratio of the video). This annotation also has a minumum size from which it cannot be reduced.

            <h3>Text highlighting notes</h3>
            <p>
                They allow you to highlight a text on the page by applying a different format. These type of notes can only be applied over a selected text on the page, and it is not possible to move or resize them. There are several types of highlighting notes that
                can be added, each of them having a different format:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Highlight text:</b> Change the background color of the selected text, maintaining the same text format.</li>
                    <li><b>Underline text:</b> Underline the selected text and change the background color.</li>
                    <li><b>Crossout text:</b> Cross out the selected text and change the background color.</li>
                    <li><b>URL:</b> Underline and bold the selected text, in addition to changing the background color. When adding this note, a dialog box is displayed to enter an URL that will be linked to the selected text. When placing the mouse over
                        this note, the mouse pointer will change to a hand, and clicking on it will open the link in a new tab. It is possible to cancel the introduction of an URL when creating the note or delete the linked URL. In that case the cursor
                        won´t change when placing it over the icon, and when clicking over it the dialog box to link an URL will be shown.</li>

            <h3>Change text</h3>
            <p>
                It is an special type of annotation, which combines a text note with a text highlighting note. As like highlighting notes, this note is applied to a text selection. This note changes the background colour of the text and shows a text note in the lower
                right corner. These types of annotations cannot be moved from the point at which they have been created, and only the text note can be resized from any edge except from the top.

            <h2>Notes creation</h2>
            <p>
                Currently this extension has 2 main methods for creating new annotations, whether text, multimedia or highlighting. Since it is not always possible to add any type of annotation, each method will behave differently depending on the type of annotation
                that is being created. In the following steps we will see both notes generation methods, remarking on the correct way to add each note type.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Context Menu</h3>
            <p>
                This extension adds a new option to the context menu of the browser. This new option, shown with the icon and the name of the extension (my notes), is added to that menu when right-clicking at any point on the page. This new entry contains a submenu with
                all the notes that can be created.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text and multimedia annotations can be added at any time, so these options will always be available in the context menu. When selecting one of these, the annotation will be created in the position that was right-clicked to open the context menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to create text highlighting notes and change text notes, you must select the text on which the note will be created before opeing the context menu. After doing this, text highlighting and change text notes will be added to the previous lists
                of notes that can be added from the context menu.
            </p>

            <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
            <p>
                The extension provides a keyboard shortcut for the creation of each type of annotation. As with the context menu, keyboard shortcuts behave differently depending on the type of note that is created. While multimedia and text notes can always be created
                (and will be created at the point of the page where the mouse was last clicked), text highlighting and text change annotations can only be created by having a selected text (if you don't have it, no annotation will be created).
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the values of the keyboard shortcuts are defined by default, they can be customized on the options page of the extension (see the Options section of this manual). This is the list of default keyboard shortcuts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio note: Ctrl+Alt+A</li>
                    <li>Video note: Ctrl+Alt+V</li>
                    <li>Text note: Ctrl+Alt+S</li>
                    <li>Change text note: Ctrl+Alt+C</li>
                    <li>URL: Ctrl+Alt+K</li>
                    <li>Highlighting text: Ctrl+Alt+H</li>
                    <li>Underline text: Ctrl+Alt+U</li>
                    <li>Crossout text: Ctrl+Alt+X</li>

            <h2>Sidebar</h2>
            <p>
                This extension adds a new sidebar to the browser. Like the rest of the sidebars, it is possible to hide or show it at any time. However, if it is shown after it has been hidden, the list of annotations will be empty. It will be necessary to reload current
                page or switch to a different tab for the annotations to be reloaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sidebar is mainly divided in 2 parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Menu: It is located in the upper left corner of the annotation, and shows the list of general options for the extension.</li>

                Clicking on this button shows a menu with general options about the extension. Each option affects to a specific group of pages, so not all options will always be available:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Export current page:</b> Creates an XML file with all the notes of the current page. This option will only be active when the current page contains annotations.

                        <b>Export everything:</b> Creates an XML file with all the annotations created in the extension.

                    <li>
                        <b>Delete current page:</b> Deletes all annotations from the current page. This option will only be active when the current page contains annotations.

                    <li>
                        <b>Delete all:</b> Deletes all the annotations of the extension.

            <h3>Page list</h3>
            <p>
                A list of the pages on which annotations have been added is displayed below the menu button. Each time a note is created on a new page, a new item is added to this list with the name of the page on which the note has been added. By default, the name assigned
                to this entry is the URL of the page, but it is possible to customize it by clicking on the name of the page and writing the new name. When you hover the mouse over that name, the full name of the page is displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each element of this list contains, at the same time, a list with all the notes added to the page. To the left of the page name an icon is displayed with which you can show/hide this list of notes. By default, all the pages are shown collapsed, except
                if there are annotations on the current page. In this case, the page is shown in first position and the list of notes is expanded. This list is automatically collapsed each time a new page is accessed or every time you change current tab.

                Each note is represented as a text box with the same background and text colours than the note it represents and with the creation date and user as text. When the mouse is placed on top of a note, the text of the note is displayed. Depending on the type
                of the note the text shonw will be different:
                <ul>
                    <li> Text selected in the case of the highlighting notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text entered in the case of the text notes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A combination of both in case of change text notes

                In addition to the new option added on the context menu of the browser, each note created on the page has a contextual menu with different actions that will affect the selected element or the elements contained within the selected element. Thus, we will
                have a different context menu in each element of the extension:

            <p>
                It will be displayed when user right-click on the note. As with all contextual menus in notes, options of this menu will not always be available, although in this case those options will be hidden instead of disabled. As the other menus, the list of available
                options depends on the type of note on which the context menu is open. The options of this menu are:

                        available, and depending on the type of note it will be applied in a different way:
                        <ul>

                        notes, only applies to the text note) and the background of its representation note in the sidebar.

                Each page of the list has a context menu that can be opened by right clicking on the page name. As in the extension context menu, all the options that cannot be applied when the menu is opened will be disabled:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Open URL: </b> Open the URL of the page in a new tab. This option is always available. </li>

                    <li> <b> Export current page: </b> Generate an XML file with the list of notes on the page. This option is always available. </li>
                    <li> <b> Copy all (open pages): </b> Copy all annotations from the page. This option will only be available when the page is open. </li>

                    <li> <b> Delete item: </b> Delete the selected note. This option is always available and cannot be undone.

            <p>
                In this page you can customize the name that will be shown as author of the note and also the default options of each note type. At right side of those options there is an example note of each type to preview the changes applied. When values are changed
                in the controls, they are validated and applied to the example note if the value is correct. If the value is incorrect, the control is highlighted to show the error. We can split the the options to configure in 2 groups depending on the
                property they affect:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Colour:</b> Sets the default colours that are going to be applied to the note. This value can be introduced by writing the colour code into the textbox (in hexadecimal) or clicking on the button at the left of the textbox (it will
                        open a new window to select the colour). Once the note has been created, it is possible to customize these values in each note.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Opacity:</b> Sets the default opacity values that will be applied to the notes. This value can be introduced by writting the value into the texbox(percentage between 0 and 100) or moving the slide control. Those values cannot
                        be modified after the creation of the notes, that will maintain the same opacity values they had when they were created forever.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Although changes done in each customization option are going to be applied automatically in the example note, they won´t be saved automatically. In order to do that it is necessary to use the buttons at the bottom of the page, that lets you do the following
                actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Save:</b> Save current values of colour and opacity of all the notes as well as the name of the user. When pressed, it will display a message indicating the result of the operation. Thus, if any of the data entered is not correct,
                        this message will show the problem and the data will not be saved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cancel:</b> Reset all the changes done on this configuration page that has not been saved yet.

                    <li>
                        <b>Default values:</b> Restore the values defined by default on this extension. Those values won´t be saved till the "Save" button is pressed.

                It lets you to customize the key combinations that will be used for each keyboard shortcut. Those shortcuts have some restrictions that must be met:
                <ul>
                    <li>It is not possible to define the keyboard shorcuts defined in Firefox. If so, when pressing the key combination, it will trigger the Firefox action instead of the extension action.</li>
                    <li>It must be a combination of 2 or 3 keys that must follow these indications:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Key Ctrl, Alt or Command</li>
                            <li>Key Ctrl, Alt, Command o Shift (this key is optional)</li>
                            <li>Letter key, number key, F key (F1-F12) or symbol key (Not all the symbols are valid). After pressing this key the whole combination will be checked before adding it, and will show an error if it is not valid.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>When defining the key combination, each key must be pressed individually. However, to use the shortcut it is necessary to press al the keys at once.</li>

            <h3>Keyboard shortcuts (2)</h3>
            <p>
                Those keyboar shortcuts won't be always available, and its behavior will change depending on the type of note that is being added:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Highlight notes and change text notes:</b> Shortcuts can be used only if there are any text selected in the page. When pressing the key combination, the note will be applied to the selected text. If there is no text selected, the
                        action will be ignored.</li>
                    <li><b>Text notes and multimedia notes:</b> Shortcuts can be used at anytime. Pressing the key combination creates a note at the last position clicked by the mouse on the page. If you have not clicked at any point of the page yet, the
                        note will be created at position 10, 10.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As happened with color options, changing a keyboard shortcut does not change it directly, but it is necessary to use the buttons at the bottom of the page to apply the changes. They are all the same buttons than in colour config page and have the same
                actions.
